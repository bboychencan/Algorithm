# 1439

I failed this problem in 2020/05/03 weekly contest, I skipped the 3rd problem and started to solve this one directly, I was confident enough 
to solve it, but after spent around 1 hour, still could not figure out the trick and estimate how many combinations there are in total.

I was very close to the right direction, but my head was too dizzy and lazy to clear it out, I thought I maybe was sleepy at that moment? 
I forgot what I did the day before that day, maybe slept very late. 

I got the first idea of using heap in 5 minutes, but I wrongly thought I just needed to add the next value of the row of the popped item.
I mistook for the concept of selecting one item from each row and calculate the sum.
