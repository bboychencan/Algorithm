# 373 find k pairs with smallest sums

I have tried solving this problem 7 months ago using a brute force way ...... and it worked ......
(I learned a lesson, brute force does help me with learning algorithm at all)

I don't know for what reason, I retried this problem 3 months ago, and the solutin looks very legit, same as the top voted 
solution. I'm not sure did I come up with that all on my own or just just borrow the top voted solution. 

And, on 2020/05/03, in the weekly contest, I confronted a similar problem and tried my best, just can't figure out the solution.

After checking the discussion, I found it's a variant based on this 373 problem, which made me feel very frustrated... 

I don't know why I can't find the solution although I obvisously had solved it before. 

I think there are several reasons.
1. I'm not in best condition this week ... (Yes, it's true, highly possibly, becasue I did not eat well, I cook for myself since this week,
and mainly Chinese food, with very heavy oil ... and I feel dizzy throughout the whole day, and did't notice that until now. I feel more lazy 
and sleepy than before, I don't want to think about difficut problems and not feel excited when facing chanllenging problems, not like before.
and I did not sleep well too, I went to bed very late, thanks to the WFH. So I decided to change from today, I will make salad as meal at least
once a day, and I will go to bed on time, let's check out if this helps.)

2. I did not solve 373 on my own last time, maybe I tried, but had no clue, and simply looked at the discussion and implemented it ......
This idea is a little tricky, it converts the problem into finding k-th value in Young-table, and the solution becomes obvious.

3. The variant in 2020/05/03 weekly contest is more complex, you need to apply the finding k-th value in Young-table multiple times.
