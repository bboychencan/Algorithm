# Chinese Remainder Theorem

I have heard about this algorithm many times before, but never spend time learning it.
It's not that easy to understand, especially if you don't have number theory or modern algebra background.

I spent hours on it, and finally nailed it and realized it's not very difficult but quite abstract.
You should be comfortable with the abstraction behind it. After you understanc it, the algorithm itself is
quite trival though.

It leverages the concept of `modular multiplicative inverse` in Modular arithmetic to assit the analysis
of this problem, which I have to say is a very handful tool when dealing with abstract concepts.

The strategy itself is very naive, the difficuty is the abstraction itself after transforming the numbers
many times.


There are two prerequisites before learning this algorithm, they both sound profound but turns out to be
very naive.
